## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a calming blue (#4CAF50 or similar) to inspire trust and reliability.
- Secondary color: Light grey or off-white for background to ensure readability.
- Font: Use a clear and readable sans-serif font like 'Roboto' or 'Open Sans' for body text.
- Headings: Use slightly larger font size and bolder weight for headings to improve structure.
- Use simple, recognizable icons for categories or actions (e.g., a scales icon for rights, a building icon for government).
- Divide the UI into clear sections: Input, Your Rights, Applicable Schemes, Next Steps.
- Use a single-column layout for easy readability on mobile devices.
- Use a subtle loading animation while Gemini processes the issue (e.g., a spinning wheel or progress bar).
